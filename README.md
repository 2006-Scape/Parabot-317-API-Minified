Parabot-317-API-Minified
========================

A tiny 317 API for Parabot v2

### About

This API uses as few as possible hooks, so adding obfuscated clients requires less work. This provider invokes the client#doAction(int) method so performing tasks is possible without any mouse/key input and thus does not require world location (tiles) to screen calculation which results in less hooks.
